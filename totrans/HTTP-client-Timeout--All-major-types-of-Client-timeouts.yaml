    can close an incoming request. Just to add, the Server timeout exists to protect
    a server from the malicious client or a slow client which is holding a connection

    languages may not give you an option to set all the timeouts which are described
    belowFor eg in golang net http package the Client struct ([https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Client](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Client))
    allows you to set a single **Timeout.** This timeout specifies below two timeouts

    the server to the receive of the entire response body from the remote server.
    It represents the max time to wait for entire client request to complete. Imagine
    an HTTP request, a request timeout specifies how much max time it will wait for
    the entire HTTP request to be completed. It is the timeout for the complete request
    so it includes **DialTimeout**, **TLSHandshakeTimeout** as well as **Response
    HeaderTimeout** and plus extra time waiting for response body.

- en: This timeout is mostly related to long-lived connections. A connection has been
    established with a remote server and some chunks of bytes also have been transferred.
    If this data flow of bytes is interrupted for a specific time, then the socket
    timeout comes into the picture.

- en: Imaging your socket timeout is 1 sec and if no new bytes are transferred for
    the next 1 sec, then it will result in socket timeout. By setting the socket timeout
    to 1 sec means that some data should be received every one second. So a socket
    timeout is waiting for individual packets and it does not mean timeout for a full
    response.

    and max connections in a pool is 20 and all connections are currently utilized.
    Your **“Wait for Connection Timeout”** is set to 1 sec. A new request comes and
    it needs a connection to connect to DB. Since all 20 connections are occupied,
    then, in this case, the new request will wait for max 1 second for connection
    to be available before timing out. In this case, the response you might get is
    **“Too many connections”** error.

    were getting used parallelly. But after that, there was no incoming request. So
    these 5 connections will wait for a value equal to “Idle Connection Timeout” before
    being released. An idle connection timeout of 1 sec should mean that a particular
    connection should not be idle for more than 1 second otherwise it will be released
    and a new connection will be creating for any new request.*
