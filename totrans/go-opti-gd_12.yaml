    certain code paths are triggered. That’s where lazy initialization becomes useful:
    it defers the construction of a value until the moment it’s actually needed. This
    pattern can improve performance, reduce startup overhead, and avoid unnecessary
    work—especially in high-concurrency applications.'

- en: Initializing heavy resources like database connections, caches, or large in-memory
    structures at startup can slow down application launch and consume memory before
    it’s actually needed. Lazy initialization defers this work until the first time
    the resource is used, keeping startup fast and memory usage lean.

    times but should only run once—ensuring that expensive operations aren’t repeated
    and that initialization remains safe and idempotent across concurrent calls.

    logic and access the result without managing flags or mutexes manually. It simplifies
    lazy loading by directly returning the computed value on demand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For cases where the initializer returns more than one value—such as a resource
    and an error—`sync.OnceValues` extends the same idea. It ensures the function
    runs exactly once and cleanly unpacks the results, keeping the code readable and
    thread-safe without boilerplate.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, it’s technically possible to replace `sync.Once`, `sync.OnceValue`, or
    `sync.OnceFunc` with custom logic using low-level atomic operations like `atomic.CompareAndSwap`
    or `atomic.Load/Store`. In rare, performance-critical paths, this can avoid the
    small overhead or allocations that come with the standard types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the trade-off is complexity. You lose the safety guarantees and clarity
    of the standard primitives, and it becomes easier to introduce subtle bugs—especially
    under concurrency. Unless profiling shows that sync.Once is a bottleneck, the
    standard versions are almost always the better choice.

    easier to get wrong—especially when concurrency and memory visibility guarantees
    are involved. For the vast majority of cases, `sync.Once*` is safer, clearer,
    and performant enough.

    It’s important to handle initialization carefully to avoid subtle issues like
    race conditions or concurrency bugs. Using built-in tools like `sync.Once` or
    `atomic` operations typically ensures thread-safety without much hassle. Still,
    it’s always a good idea to measure actual improvements through profiling, confirming
    lazy initialization truly enhances startup speed, reduces memory usage, or boosts
    your application's responsiveness.

    as the main benefit is deferring expensive resource creation. The performance
    gains are inherently tied to the avoided cost of unnecessary initialization, startup
    speed improvements, and reduced memory consumption, rather than direct runtime
    throughput differences.
