Below are naming conventions for variables and constant in golang

*   A variable or constant name can only start with a letter or an underscore.

*   It can be followed by any number of letters, numbers or underscores after that

*   Go is case sensitive so uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently.

*   The variable or constant name cannot be any keyword name in Go

*   There is no limit on the length of variable or constant name. But is advisable to have the variable name of optimum length.
