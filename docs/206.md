# Index character in a string in Go (Golang)

> 原文：[https://golangbyexample.com/go-index-character-string/](https://golangbyexample.com/go-index-character-string/)

In Golang string is a sequence of bytes. A string literal actually represents a UTF-8 sequence of bytes. In UTF-8, ASCII characters are single-byte corresponding to the first 128 Unicode characters. All other characters are between 1 -4 bytes. Due to this, it is not possible to index a character in a string.

 For example, see below the program and its output.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    sample := "ab£c"
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        fmt.Printf("%c\n", sample[i])
    }
    fmt.Printf("Length is %d\n", len(sample))
}
```

**Output:**

```
a
b
Â
£
Length is 5
```

As you might have noticed, it prints different characters than expected and length is also 5 instead of 4\. Why is that? To answer please remember we said that a string is essentially a slice of bytes. Let's print that slice of bytes using

```
sample := "ab£c"
fmt.Println([]byte(sample))
```

The output will be

```
[97 98 194 163 99]
```

This is the mapping of each of character to its byte sequence. As you can notice **a**, **b**, **c** take each 1 byte but **£** takes two bytes. That is why the length of the string is 5 and not 4

<figure class="wp-block-table">

| `a` | `97` |
| `b` | `98` |
| `£` | `194, 163` |
| `c` | `99` |

</figure>

Then how we can index into a string. This is where **rune** data type comes into picture In GO, **rune** data type represents a Unicode point. You can learn more about rune here - [https://golangbyexample.com/understanding-rune-in-golang](https://golangbyexample.com/understanding-rune-in-golang)

Once a string is converted to an array of **rune** then it is possible to index a character in that array of rune. See below code

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    sample := "ab£c"
    sampleRune := []rune(sample)

    fmt.Printf("%c\n", sampleRune[0])
    fmt.Printf("%c\n", sampleRune[1])
    fmt.Printf("%c\n", sampleRune[2])
    fmt.Printf("%c\n", sampleRune[3])
}
```

**Output:**

```
a
b
£
c
```

Also to mention you can use range operator to iterate over all Unicode characters in the string, but to index character in a string, you can convert it to an array of **rune**.
