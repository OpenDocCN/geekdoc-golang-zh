- en: In Golang string is a sequence of bytes. A string literal actually represents
    a UTF-8 sequence of bytes. In UTF-8, ASCII characters are single-byte corresponding
    to the first 128 Unicode characters. All other characters are between 1 -4 bytes.
    Due to this, it is not possible to index a character in a string.  In GO, rune
    data type represents a Unicode point.  Once a string is converted to an array
    of rune then it is possible to index a character in that array of rune.

    by index, we  are first converting a string into a rune array so that we can index
    the rune array and then delete the character by index
