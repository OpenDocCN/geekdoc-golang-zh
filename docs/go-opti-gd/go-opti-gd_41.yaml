- en: DNS resolution tends to fly under the radar, but it can still slow down Go applications.
    Even brief delays in lookups can stack up in distributed or microservice architectures
    where components frequently communicate. Understanding how Go resolves DNS under
    the hood — and how to adjust it — can make your service more responsive and reliable.

    resolver and the **cgo-based** resolver.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `pure-Go` resolver is fully self-contained and avoids using any external
    DNS libraries. It reads its configuration from `/etc/resolv.conf` (on Unix-like
    systems) and talks directly to the configured nameservers. This makes it simple
    and generally performant, though it sometimes struggles to handle more exotic
    or highly customized DNS environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, the **cgo-based** resolver delegates DNS resolution to the operating
    system’s own resolver (through the C standard library, `libc`). This gives better
    compatibility with complicated or custom DNS environments—like those involving
    LDAP or multicast DNS—but it also comes with a tradeoff. The cgo resolver adds
    overhead due to calls into external C libraries, and it can sometimes lead to
    issues around thread safety or unpredictable latency spikes.

- en: A cgo-enabled binary relies on the system’s C runtime (`libc.so.6`) and the
    dynamic loader (`ld-linux`). Without these shared libraries available on the host,
    the binary won’t start — which makes it unsuitable for stripped-down environments
    like scratch containers.

    on shared libraries at runtime. Because of this, pure-Go builds are a good fit
    for minimal containers or bare environments without a C runtime, offering better
    portability and fewer operational surprises. The downside is that these binaries
    can’t take advantage of system-level resolver features that require cgo and the
    host’s `libc`.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Caching DNS results prevents the application from sending the same queries over
    and over, which can eliminate a noticeable amount of latency. Each lookup incurs
    at least one network round-trip, and when this happens at scale, the cumulative
    cost can become a serious drag on service performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many operating systems and hosting environments already include some form of
    DNS caching. On Windows, the `DNS Client` service keeps a local cache; on macOS,
    `mDNSResponder` handles this; and on most Linux systems, `systemd-resolved` or
    `nscd` often provides a caching layer. In cloud environments, DNS queries are
    often routed through a nearby caching resolver inside the same data center. These
    mechanisms do help reduce latency, but they operate transparently to the application
    and offer little visibility or control over TTLs and policies. On Linux, if `systemd-resolved`
    isn’t enabled, no caching happens at all unless you configure it explicitly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since Go itself doesn’t include any DNS caching, you have to implement it yourself
    if you want fine-grained, application-level control. One option is to run your
    own caching DNS server nearby; another is to embed a lightweight cache directly
    in your code, using a third-party library.

    and make your service fragile if upstream addresses change. It’s worth tuning
    your cache expiration times so they reflect how often the domains you rely on
    actually change.

    "Permanent link")
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In latency-sensitive services, it often makes sense to resolve DNS up front
    or use a custom dialer to control resolution explicitly. Every call to `net.Dial`
    or `net.DialContext` with a hostname triggers a lookup, which can involve syscalls,
    context switches, and sometimes even a network round-trip if the cache is cold.
    At high throughput, this overhead adds up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To eliminate this overhead, you can resolve hostnames during startup and save
    the resulting IPs. This approach is particularly effective when dealing with a
    fixed set of endpoints that rarely change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE5]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: One drawback is that it fixes the IP for the lifetime of the process, so if
    the endpoint changes its address, connections may start failing. To handle this
    gracefully, you can run a background goroutine that refreshes the resolved IP
    at regular intervals.

- en: 'Custom dialers take it one step further: they allow you to control how DNS
    resolution and socket establishment occur on a per-connection basis. This will
    enable you to force connections through a specific resolver, hardwire pre-resolved
    IP addresses, or even bypass DNS completely by dialing IP addresses directly.'

    through a dedicated, faster nameserver. They give you precise control over how
    resolution happens, but that control comes with added complexity — you’ll need
    to handle fallback and refresh logic yourself.

    how much time lookups actually add to each request. The simplest way is to wrap
    your DNS calls with a timer that starts just before the lookup and records the
    duration after it completes. Over time, these measurements help you identify trends,
    spot intermittent slowness, and correlate DNS delays with other parts of your
    system.

    DNS problems that standard metrics often miss.

    to your service can eliminate the extra latency of external lookups. If security
    and privacy are concerns, enabling DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT)
    is also an option, though it comes with some additional latency due to encryption.
    Finally, reviewing and tuning your `/etc/resolv.conf` — adjusting retry counts
    and timeout settings — helps ensure the resolver behaves predictably under load
    or failure conditions.
